DONE ----- Get Pytest working on palnisphere_tests.py and app_tests.py

DONE ----- Get moving through all Rooms working

WIP --- Think about how to implement Parser
(Needed Categories:

Directions by direct naming of the room - i.e. 'Flur' ----- can directions be imported into the Lexicon from planisphere?
Objects - i.e. 'Tür', 'Tisch', etc...
Verbs - i.e. 'geh'/'gehen', 'schlag'/'schlagen', 'nimm'/'nehmen', 'iss'/'essen'

How to deal with synonyms?

Decide on one single basic command name (i.e. direction name, object name, verb name)
For each command name create a list with synonyms.
If input is in that list replace input with basic command name

Available object interaction combination:

Should be easy to input combinations - i.e. I want that if the user tries to
use that object with that object that this happens. These combinations could be stored
in a nested dictionary: http://python.omics.wiki/data-structures/dictionary/multiple-keys

We want:
Set of basic direction names(imported)
Set of basic verb names(determined in lexicon_resources)
Set of basic object names(imported)

A way to store synonyms and their basic name
A way to find synonyms in the input and replace them with the basic name


Tasks:

DONE ------ Import Directions and Objects to Lexicon from planisphere.py
Create basic actions ('go', 'hit', 'take')
DONE ------ Implement synonym processing in lexicon so that every input is converted to the determined command names.
